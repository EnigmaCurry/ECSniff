This code is educational for me. It teaches me several things
about TCP/IP. This is my intent for you as well. I claim no
responsibility for what you will do with this program. Although
I cannot stop someone from doing something malicious with this
software, I do hope, that by it's existance, a general awareness
of the problems with insecure protocols will proliferate.
